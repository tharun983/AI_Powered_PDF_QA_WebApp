While working on this project, I was using Chatgpt and I thought it would have been nice if I could add people to the conversation and they can comment on the code and we can discuss about the assignment.
So I tried adding a feature to add people so that we can have a chat on the website and comment on the responses for the queries.

And ofcourse I can't say this is a fully functioning model project, because I didnt know how to make the username people to make comments, but if i got this job, I would like to work on these type of projects.
